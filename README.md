# Which technologies did I use to develop this app? :thinking:

I used Angular-CLI to create my Angular App. <br>

# Which is the purpose of this web app? :thinking:

It is a web app I made based on Fernando Herrera Angular course üßê. I havent made barely changes compared to the project that Fernando Herrera made on the course, but just because I want to learn and adquire the Angular knowledge ü§ì. I know the styles are very basic, but I just focused on Angular stuff. I learnt with this project about:

‚ù§Ô∏è Good practices about making reusable components in Angular. <br>
‚ù§Ô∏è Good practices about Angular folder structure. <br>
:heart: Using Router Module and RouterLink.<br>
:heart: Using children routes.  <br>
:heart: Implementation of Lazy Load.  <br>
:heart: Working with services. <br>
:heart: Using Quicktype to generate interfaces. <br>
:heart: Customized pipes. 
:heart: How to do clean http requests.<br>
:open_mouth: Using JSON Server to work with a non-SQL DB directly from the frontend side. <br>
:blue_heart: TypeScript. <br>
:art: Angular Material.  <br>
:art: Angular Flex-Layout.  <br>
