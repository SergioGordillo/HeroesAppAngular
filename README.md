# Can I try this web app? :open_mouth:

Yes. If you want to check it, you need to: <br>

1) Download the project and install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/es/). After that, with the command `npm install` (https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install), you will install all the node_modules needed for the app to work. <br>
2) Download the no-SQL DB for this project. You can download it from here (https://github.com/SergioGordillo/HeroesAppAngularDB). <br>
3) Ok. So, open with your favourite IDE both projects (HeroesAppAngular and HeroesAppAngularDB). <br>
4) HeroesAppAngularDB will run with the command `json-server --watch db.json` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server). <br>
5) HeroesAppAngular will run with the command `ng serve -o`. <br>

So, enjoy the app :grinning:

# Which technologies did I use to develop this app? :thinking:

It is a web app made with Angular 12 + TypeScript + Angular Material + Animate.css <br>
I used Angular-CLI to create my Angular App. <br>

# Which is the purpose of this web app? :thinking:

It is a web app I made based on Fernando Herrera Angular course üßê. I havent made barely changes compared to the project that Fernando Herrera made on the course, but just because I want to learn and adquire the Angular knowledge ü§ì. I know the styles are very basic, but I just focused on Angular stuff. I learnt with this project about:

‚ù§Ô∏è Good practices about making reusable components in Angular. <br>
‚ù§Ô∏è Good practices about Angular folder structure. <br>
:heart: Using Router Module and RouterLink.<br>
:heart: Using children routes.  <br>
:heart: Implementation of Lazy Load.  <br>
:heart: Working with services. <br>
:heart: Using Quicktype to generate interfaces. <br>
:heart: Customized pipes. <br>
:heart: How to do clean http requests.<br>
:heart: Creation of a basic login system. <br>
:heart: Use of CanActivate and CanLoad guards. <br>
:heart: Use of LocalStorage <br>
:open_mouth: Using JSON Server to work with a non-SQL DB directly from the frontend side. <br>
:blue_heart: TypeScript. <br>
:art: Angular Material.  <br>
:art: Angular Flex-Layout.  <br>
